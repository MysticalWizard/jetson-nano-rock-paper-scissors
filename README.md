#  Rock Paper Scissors Image Recognition Project

## Introduction
This project is a image recognition tool for the game 'Rock paper scissors'

## Capabilities
This AI is able to classify "rock", "paper", and "scissors" in the game 'Rock paper scissors'. It has been tested on different angles and rotations of the hand.

## Setup Guide

## Current Limitations
Currently, the AI performs worse in low light environments. However, I belive that this issue can be resolved by training the AI with more low lit images and with various backgrounds.

## Equipment
- NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit
- An USB Camera
